L2:
Elements with context
	switch panel
	pan
	Manual contrast
	Layout
	Contrast presets

CONFLICTS: modifier zoom out == context manual contrast
		   modifier presets 1 == modifier switch panel up (SAME IN CODE)

similar modifiers:
	pan == switch

L3:
Elements with context:
	Scroll
	flip
	rotate
	zoom
	switch panel
	Pan
	window
	manual contrast
	layout
	contrast presets
CONFLICTS: modifier zoom out == context manual contrast
		   modifier contrast presets 1 and 2 are == modifier layout 1 and 2 (SAME IN CODE)

similar modifiers
	pan left/right = switch left/right


L6:
Elements with context
	flip
	manual contrast
	contrast_presets
	Layout


CONFLICTS: 	modifier zoom out == modifier ruler measure 

Toggles:
	ruler delete when ruler measure has been used -> confused context lists


L8:
Elements with context
	
CONFLICTS: ruler measure commands == window open cliose commands	

Toggles:
	ruler delete when ruler measure has been used -> confused context lists (full command)
	window close when window open has been used -> confused contexs (full command)



NOTE make rules -> a the  direction is detected for scroll, pan, manual contras or switch panel, but we are in a different context, use that context instead


if rules that need to be made:
	if the modifiers are similar --> use the one of the context
	if the modifier does not exist --> ignore
	if the contexts or coomands can be confused --> send execution option
	commands that need to be toogled form x list when used with counter

Things to fix:
	re-name flip vertical L8
	record layout for L6
